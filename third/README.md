# Lessons learned

__Start at entry points. Use stubs. Be incremental.__


Be incremental, which means create a sequence of runnable prototypes with small deltas.
To do this, you need to use stubs.
Also, start at a program entry point.

Here's the process desccribed in steps:

1) Create a simple program that displays something to standard out.

2) Determine a small increment of development that results in a runnable system (a delta of evolution).

3) Compile, test and fix bugs until prototype runs as intended.

4) If the prototype meets all requirements, you're done, else return to step 2.
