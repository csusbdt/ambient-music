# Lessons learned

__Start at entry points. Use stubs. Be incremental.__


Create a sequence of runnable prototypes with small deltas.

1) Create a simple program that displays something to standard out.

2) Determine a small increment of development that results in a runnable system (a delta of evolution).

3) Compile and run.

If it's not the final system, return to step 2.
